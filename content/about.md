Roaming Bath is a project to highlight the literary history of Bath - pairing literary events with places.  For example the writing of *Frankenstein* at 5 Abbey Church Yard, or the writing of *Midnight on Beechen* at Alexandra Park. 

## How it works
Posters at key locations in Bath will illustrate the stories featured on the website - these will also be *interactive* and encourage users to access further content on mobile devices by using contactless and barcode technology.

## what to do if you find a poster
Posters of each Bath story will illustrate the key points and the location.  Extra content will be electronically accessible by scanning a phone or tablet to the poster.  This can either be done using QR codes or NFC.

### what is NFC?
> NFC (Near Field Communication) is *contactless* technology, allowing exchange of data by holding devices near to other devices, or objects.  An example is the more common use of contactless technology in payment cards, or established situtions like Oyster cards on the London underground.

The NFC logo is used to provide a recognisable sign for users.  Where the logo is displayed on physical objects, that object should be enabled for contactless technology.  Many modern phones support contactless technology.

### what is a QR code?

> A QR code is like a traditional barcode but in 2 dimensions, meaning that it can hold a lot more information.  

Most modern smart phones support QR codes, although you may need a QR code scanner *app* to enable you to scan these codes.

## where to find the posters
You can hunt out posters of Bath literary stories in Council buildings in Bath and North East Somerset.
