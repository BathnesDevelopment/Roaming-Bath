## Frankenstein

The novel was said to have been inspired by a dream in 1816 – also taking inspiration from travels through Europe and topics of galvanism (muscles stimulated by electric current) and the occult.  It is argued to be one of the first examples of science-fiction.

## Location

*5 Abbey Church Yard*. An address that now no longer exists, Mary and Percy Shelley stayed here in 1816.  The building was demolished and made way for an extension to the Pump Rooms.

When visiting the Pump Rooms (and the Abbey!), take a look at the following image and compare it to how the building looks now:
