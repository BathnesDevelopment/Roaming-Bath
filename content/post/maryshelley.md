Mary Shelley lived in Bath in 1816 and wrote the second half of Frankenstein while living at Abbey Church Yard.

## Frankenstein



## Location

*5 Abbey Church Yard*. An address that now no longer exists, Mary and Percy Shelley stayed here in 1816.  The building was demolished and made way for an extension to the Pump Rooms.

When visiting the Pump Rooms (and the Abbey!) take a look at the following image and compare it to how the building looks now:
