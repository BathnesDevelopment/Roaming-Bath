Charles Dickens visited Bath on a number of occasions, often to visit his friend, Walter Savage Landor, at 35 St Jamesâ€™s Square.  There is a plaque outside that address declaring that Dickens stayed there, although there does not appear to be evidence for this.

## The Pickwick Papers

Later on, Dickens part-set The Pickwick Papers in Bath:

> 'Welcome to Ba-ath, Sir.  This is indeed an acquisition.  Most welcome to Ba-ath, sir.  It is long--very long, Mr. Pickwick, since you drank the waters.  It appears an age, Mr. Pickwick. Re-markable!'

## Location

*The Saracen's Head*. Dickens stayed at The Saracen's Head as a reporter in 1835 to report on a speech by Lord John Russell.
