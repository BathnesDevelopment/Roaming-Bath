For books, the local history collection can be found in the Central Library, which will include many books for investigating the history of authors in Bath, works published in Bath, and generally providing a rich experience when *roaming* Bath.  Please see the librarians for recommendations.

## Library Thing
[LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/) is a site for book lovers that includes a large amount of information on books.  Particularly, it includes data on books set in particular places.  For a list of books set in Bath, see the [list of books set in Bath](https://data.bathhacked.org/Heritage/Library-Thing-Books-Set-in-Bath/9hx2-yxis), compiled by Bath: Hacked.

## British National Bibliography
